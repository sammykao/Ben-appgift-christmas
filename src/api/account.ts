/**
 * API for account management operations.

 * - Domain: User account lifecycle (deletion)
 * - Security: Only authenticated users can delete their own account
 * - Cascade: Deleting auth.users will cascade to all related tables via foreign keys
 * 
 * Important: Client-side deletion of auth.users requires a database function.
 * The recommended approach is to create a database function that handles
 * the deletion server-side with proper permissions.

/**
 * Delete the current user's account and all associated data.
 * 
 * Architecture Note:
 * - Uses a database RPC function to delete the user account
 * - Cascade deletes will automatically remove:
 *   - profiles (via ON DELETE CASCADE)
 *   - journal_entries (via user_id foreign key)
 *   - notification_preferences (via user_id foreign key)
 *   - All related data in dependent tables
 * 
 * Security:
 * - User must be authenticated
 * - Can only delete their own account
 * - This is a destructive operation with no undo
 * 
 * Database Setup Required:
 * - Create a database function `delete_user_account()` that:
 *   1. Deletes all user data from public tables
 *   2. Deletes the user from auth.users
 *   3. Handles all cascade relationships
